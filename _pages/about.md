I am a Machine Learning (ML) graduate researcher at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), supervised by [Prof. Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri](https://mmamiri.github.io/).

My expertise encompasses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), data evaluation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), feature engineering, and web development.

With a strong foundation in research, my academic journey at Tsinghua University focused on health management and data generation. My professional experience includes internships at Didi Chuxing and GliaCloud, where I honed my skills in translating research into practical, customer-centric products.

Currently pursuing further ML research at RPI, my work centers on LLMs, with a particular emphasis on the intersection of LLM technology and data evaluation. My research aims to enhance the value and human alignment of LLM outputs.

My diverse international research and industry experiences have cultivated my leadership abilities, teamwork skills, critical thinking, self-directed learning capacity, and innovative mindset. I bring a unique blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application to the field of Machine Learning.
